# Time-varying-metasurface
This is the project I worked on during my postdoc study for the study of time-varying metasurface for parametric wave generation and control.

The matlab programes developed include equipment control for automatic measurement, which are combined with a machine learning part based on evolutionary algorithm to optimize the control parameters of the equipment.
